More readable ascii mathematics - converting straight to LaTeX

It's not meant to be usable for every kind of an equation. If something's not supported you'll be able to paste native latex (todo)

The idea is - be more readable, shorter, easier to learn, "compilable" to latex.

Bad code practices, all in HTML XD
It's made mostly for me, so if something triggers you, you're welcome to change it.
I'm too lazy to organize it in a pretty way :)
